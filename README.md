# mingo-basic

Mingo - The game of Mingo involves 100 x 100 board with unique positive whole number in the range of 1 to 1,000,000 randomly distributed in the cells. Unique numbers are "called" one at a time and the goal is to have a "Mingo" which is an entire row or column or cells with numbers that have been "called"; one might also form a diagonal from corner to corner with number that have been "called".

Write a function that takes as parametrers a square array of 100 x 100 positive whole numbers and a list of "called" numbers. Your function will report whether a "mingo" occurs, and after how many called numbers to the first mingo occurs. You may assume a valid input.
